    "- The default Python API for H3 (via `import h3` or `import h3.api.basic_str`), represents indices in their hexadecimal format as a Python strs and uses standard Python collection types like set and list. These conventions make it more natural to work with h3-py objects in Python, but come at the cost of converting back and forth between the C and Python representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will be using the *default* Python API (h3.api.basic_str) in this notebook. Therefore, whenever the term **\"h3\"** is used in the H3 functions in this notebook, it refers to a `string` representation of the H3 Index (which is a hexadecimal string equivalent of the actual `H3Index` 64-bit integer value).\n",
